# Keylogger with Executable Creation üñ•Ô∏èüîë

This Python script is a basic keylogger for educational purposes. It logs all keystrokes into a `log.txt` file and includes functionality to create a standalone executable using PyInstaller.

## Features ‚ú®
- Logs all keystrokes, including special keys like `Space`, `Enter`, and `Backspace`.
- Saves logged keys to a `log.txt` file in the same directory as the script.
- Option to create a `.exe` file using PyInstaller for easy distribution.

## Usage üöÄ
This message is specific to Python on systems like **Kali Linux**, where Python package installations are managed to avoid potential system conflicts. It indicates that the environment is configured to prevent global changes to Python packages. To install external Python packages, you have a few options:

---
### . Debugging Tips
If the issue persists:
 **Check PyInstaller Logs**:
   PyInstaller logs the build process. Look for error messages in the console.
   
 **Run PyInstaller Manually**:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --noconsole -F k.py
   ```

 **Check Permissions**:
   Ensure you have write access to the directory.

 **Environment**:
   Use a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

---
####  **Install System-Wide Using `apt`**
For packages available through `apt`, you can use:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pynput
```
This is the safest method for system-wide installation.

---

####  **Use a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
Virtual environments isolate your Python dependencies from the system, preventing conflicts. Here's how to use one:

 **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```

 **Activate the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

 **Install Required Packages**:
   Inside the activated environment, install the `pynput` library:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```

 **Run Your Python Scripts**:
   Use the Python interpreter from the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   myenv/bin/python k.py
   ```

 **Deactivate the Environment**:
   When done, deactivate it with:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
Ensure you have `PyInstaller` installed:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

####  **Use `pipx` for Application Isolation**
`pipx` installs Python applications in isolated environments. Install `pipx` first:
```bash
sudo apt install pipx
```

Then, use `pipx` to install and manage the `pynput` library:
```bash
pipx install pynput
```

---

####  **Override System Restriction (Not Recommended)**
If you understand the risks, you can force `pip` to install packages system-wide using:
```bash
pip install --break-system-packages pynput
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This can potentially break system-installed Python applications.

---

###  Run the Keylogger
To start the keylogger, simply execute the script:
```bash
python keylogger.py
```
The keylogger will log all keystrokes to a file named `log.txt`. Press `Esc` to stop the keylogger.


## Requirements üì¶
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `pynput`
  - `pyinstaller`

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
This script is for **educational purposes only**. Do not use it for malicious activities. Always ensure you have permission to log keystrokes on the device you are using.
